# Apple Store: Design Patterns

This is a collection of the classic design patterns applied to a single domain: the Apple Store.

The goal is to offer a reference for applying these concepts within a specific domain and demonstrate how they can be integrated with SwiftUI view models.

## Adapter

> Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Bridge

> Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Builder

> Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Chain of Responsibility

> Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Command

> Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Decorator

> Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Facade

> Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Factory

> Abstract Factory: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
>
> Factory Method: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Flyweight

> Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Iterator

> Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Mediator

> Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Memento

> Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Observer

> Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Prototype

> Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Proxy

> Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Singleton

> Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## State

> Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Strategy

> Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Template Method

> Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure.
>
> _Reference: Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software_

## Visitor

> Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates.
>
